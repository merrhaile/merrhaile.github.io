 *  how much a person is allowed to temporarily withdraw beyond what they have. In other 
 * words, itâ€™s the amount that an account is allowed to go into the red (negative balance). 
 * Be sure to set this value in the constructor and create a getter and a setter for it. 
 * Also make sure that you override the withdraw(amount) method and the toString() method. 
 * Test with bankTests.js.
