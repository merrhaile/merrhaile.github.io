                        <p class="h5">Introduction</p>
                        The HIV/AIDS program under the Ministry of Health (MOH) Eritrea, starting in 2012, shifted from Option A to the treatment approach recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) (Option B+).  Option B+ offers lifelong Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) for pregnant mothers regardless of their CD4 count, with a goal to maintain and improve the health of HIV-positive mothers and to reduce mother-to-child transmission of HIV. The aim of our study is to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of Option B+ compared to Option A for HIV-positive pregnant women within the Eritrean context. 
                        <p class="h5">Methods</p>
                        An Excel-based decision analytical model was developed from the perspective of Eritrean health system to compare the cost and health outcomes of the WHO-recommended PMTCT intervention, Option B+, with Option A in an annual cohort of 612 women initiating antenatal care based on the population and resources of the calendar year 2017. The analysis was structured so that an annual cohort of HIV-positive pregnant women received PMTCT services under the current intervention (Option B+) compared against a hypothetical scenario if the same group had received PMTCT services under Option A. Cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted under two separate models: model 1 examined infections averted in infants and model 2 assessed lifetime cost-effectiveness analysis of HIV-positive mothers.
                        <p class="h5">Results</p>
                        Compared to the counterfactual scenario (Option A), the current PMTCT practice (Option B+), with an increased cost of 51,195 USD, averted a higher number of mother-to-child transmissions of HIV and resulted in 3,355 incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALY)s gained, with an ICER value of 15 USD per QALYs gained. In the lifetime cost-effectiveness analysis of the two interventions, Option B+ gained 1,907 QALYs at a cost 21,502 USD above the corresponding values in Option A. The ICER of Option B+ in the lifetime cost effectiveness analysis is 11 USD per QALYs gained. The ICERs per QALY gained of both models are less than the 1.00 times Eritrea’s GNI per capita (1083 USD), showing that Option B+ very cost effective. 
                        <p class="h5">Conclusion</p>
                        The finding of the study supports the steps taken by the HIV/AIDS program to move to Option B+, according to 2013 WHO guidelines. Option B+ was very cost-effective compared to Option A. It provides greater health benefit to HIV-positive mothers when extended over the mothers’ lifetime and averts more infant infections (around 40% more infections) compared to the previous approach, Option A.
