                    <p class="h4">Abstract</h4>
                    <p>
                        <p class="h5">Introduction</p>
                        Malaria remains a major cause of illness and death globally especially in the developing world. According to a WHO report, in 2016 an estimated 216 million (95% CI: 196-263) cases of malaria were reported, 90% of which occurred in Africa, and deaths have reached 445,000 (World Health Organization, 2018). However, in the last decade, significant and well-coordinated efforts by the international community resulted in a worldwide reduction in the transmission of malaria as well as in the overall malaria morbidity and mortality. The implementation of malaria control measures, Integrated Vector Management (IVM) and strong case management, have proven to reduce the burden of malaria to a lower level in many endemic regions within a short time.
                        As in any sub-Saharan Africa countries, malaria is still a public health concern in Eritrea. The disease most commonly occurs in the eastern and western lowlands of the country. The National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) incorporates five thematic areas of management in fighting malaria. At the center of all the thematic areas is program management, which mainly focuses on human resources, logistics, and the development of policies and guidelines. The NMCP implements all the WHO recommended components of IVM, namely biological control, environmental management, and chemical control. 

                        <p class="h5">Methods</p>
                        A prospective randomized control trial will be employed to test whether the proposed hypothesis gives rise to the desired outcome. IRS will be implemented in selected intervention groups and compared with comparable control groups drawn from the study population. The study population comprises people living in the four malarious zones of the country. A pre- and post-test will be conducted to measure the parasite prevalence in the study subzones and compare the outcomes in the control and intervention groups.
                        <p class="h6">Duration of the Study </p>
                        The study will be carried out in two malaria seasons in 2018 and 2019. In the first malaria season, only a malaria prevalence survey will be conducted as a pre-test in October 2018 to serve as a baseline. In the second season, IRS will be implemented in the intervention groups in July 2019, followed by the post-test in October 2019. 
                        <p class="h6">Sampling</p>
                        A Stratified random sampling method will be implemented to determine the subzones that will be enrolled in the study. A list of subzones for all four zones that will be used as a sample frame will be retrieved from Health Management Information System (HMIS), Ministry of Health. From a total of 52 subzones located in the four malarious zones, 12 subzones will be randomly selected. Each zone will have two subzones selected for the study, one in the control group and the other in the intervention group. Households in the intervention subzones will receive IRS in addition to ITNs, and environmental management and households in the control group will benefit from all vector control measures but IRS.

                        <p class="h5">Contribution to Science</p>
                        Although it has been proven that Indoor Residual Spray (IRS) plays a big role in the reduction of malaria prevalence in many malarious parts of the world(Kim, Fedak, & Kramer, 2012), this research will bolster the existing findings in other settings and provide evidence of the effectiveness of the particular vector control measure within the context of the country. The evidence of this research will serve as a tool for decision making and to formulate new policy or modify existing policy with regard to vector control.
